# Python_instacart_Analysis
# Objective:
The objective of this data analysis project is to utilize Python to analyze data from Instacart's online grocery basket. The project aims to achieve the following goals:

**Data Cleaning and Merging:** The project involves cleaning and merging four primary data sets: orders, products, department, and customer data. By removing duplicates, resolving missing values, and addressing mixed or incorrect data types, the data will be prepared for further analysis.

**Marketing and Sales Analysis:** The data will be analyzed to answer various questions from the marketing and sales teams. This analysis will include determining the busiest time of day, identifying the highest grossing days of the week, and identifying the most loyal customers, among other relevant insights.

**User Ordering Habits Analysis:** The data will be examined to discover differences in users' ordering habits based on various characteristics such as region, income, loyalty status, and more. By exploring these patterns, the project aims to uncover valuable insights into customer behavior.

**Customer Profiling:** Customer profiles will be created based on combinations of variables, such as pet owners or vegetarian/vegan customers. The project will analyze how these different customer segments exhibit distinct ordering behaviors.

**Data:**
The data for this project consists of multiple data sets related to Instacart's online grocery basket. These include orders, products, department, and customer data. These data sets will be combined and analyzed to extract meaningful insights.

# Tools:
The project will be implemented using the following tools:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scipy
Software: Jupyter Notebooks and Excel
# Skills Demonstrated:
Throughout the project, the following skills will be demonstrated:

**Data Cleaning:** The data sets will undergo cleaning processes to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure correct data types.

**Data Merging:** The data sets will be merged, ensuring successful integration, and the final merge will be exported as a pkl file.

**Exploratory Analysis:** Basic descriptive statistics, such as maximum, minimum, quartiles, mean, and standard deviation, will be calculated. Histograms, scatterplots, and bar and line charts will be utilized to explore the distribution of data.

**Derived Variables:** New variables will be created by grouping data based on user, order, and department. This will enable exploration and analysis at each level. Flags related to user ordering habits and demographic information will also be derived and validated using crosstabs and value counts.

**Data Visualization:** Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries will be used to create visualizations, including histograms, line charts, pie charts, and bar charts (vertical/horizontal, stacked, and 100% stacked).

**Reporting Results:** The project will provide an Excel file documenting the answers to sales/marketing questions, data population flow, consistency checks, data wrangling steps, and column derivations.

By conducting this data analysis project, valuable insights will be derived from the Instacart online grocery basket data, contributing to informed decision-making and strategic planning for the company.
